<h5>I'm certain for the most part that I will be collaborating with two other students to work on an app that will help alert people when they need to take their medication and how much they need to take.</h5>

<br><h6>What type of coding language(s) will we be using to complete the project?What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project?</h6>
<p>It seems that as of right now we'll be using Java because we are supposed to create an app. We were told in class that we can use Java to create an Android app. In class we are currently learning Java but also we have been learning overall for the past few years that if you do get stuck ask for help or doing LOYO. LOYO just means learning on your own and this is when we utilize the internet as a tool to help us learn something new. Both LOYO and asking for help can be essential to big projects because coding is trial and error.  </p>
<br><h6> How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project?</h6>
<p>I've partnered and or seen the work ethicof my other groupmates so Iknow one skill we won't struggle too much with is communication. One skill I personally believe that I should work on is organization. I try to stay organized with papers and such but I forget to use tab and separate the lines to make it more readable to others in my code. I also have to work on adding comments to my code to ensure that I know what each piece is being used for. As a group I think overall we'll do well.</p>
