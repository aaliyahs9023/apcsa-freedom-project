<h3>What are you using to learn?</h3>
<!--Uses (and links to) multiple sources effectively, where applicable.-->


<p>
We have currently finished the Freedom Project and in order to successfully reach our end project we had to gather a multitude of different sources.
While not all of the sources we came across were used in our project it did help us find out what couldn't be used in our project enabling us to compare to other sources to see if they're the same or similar.
The two links that helped us the most I'd say are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W07OAiJCHa0">this youtube video</a> and <a href="Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Nr3AT7fF4">this other youtube video</a>.

<h3>Where are you at in the process of your product? </h3>

<!--//Effectively considers current stage in EDP, plans for next stage.
Must state “engineering design process.”-->

<p>
I'd say in our engineering design process we are at the point where we just need to improve as needed because we have reached our minimiun viable product.
Our product does work and we know this because of the mutliple tests ran to ensure that our alarm worked on the most basic level.
We have reached the point overall where we are content with the final project.
</p>



<h3>What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project?
</h3>
<!--
Displays knowledge gained that applies to this entry, where applicable.-->

<p>
Over the course of this year one thing we've been taught that has stuck with me is to ask for help.
There have been many times where I didn't know something and I would struggle but in the end it's better to ask questions than to sit and struggle on your own.
I had ery helpful partners who I'd turn to to ask questions about various things such as what they were working on and what still needed to be done.
This was vital for the process of coding this project because without asking eachother questions and communication in general we would run into more problems such as merge conflicts.
</p>




<h3>How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project?</h3>

<!--Reflects on at least two skills developed since the previous entry.-->
<!--Must state “skill/skills.”-->

<p>
The two most important skills I got out of doing this project with two of my other peers are communication and learning how to google.
Communication is key within partnerships especially for projects with coding because merge conflicts are always a possibility.
Learning how to google was also essential to this project because that's definitely something we had to utilize for this project because we needed to use google in order to complete the project.
