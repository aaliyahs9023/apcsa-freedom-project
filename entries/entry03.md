<h3>What are you using to learn?</h3>
<!--Uses (and links to) multiple sources effectively, where applicable.-->


<p> In my previous blog entry I stated that my role in the project would be to learn and utilize firebase but we realized as a group that that wouldn't be included in our MVP(minimum viable product).
We have decided to keep it simple for now and if we have extra time to add in firebase to our project.
I have begun to research other apps and their overall outlook.
This will help us to see what aesthetic we're going for and depending on the reviews on the app it will help us get an idea on what consumers like.
The website that I had found was actually extremely useful as  <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-reminder-apps-for-android-654628/">it was strictly regarding android apps</a>.
We have also found a link in which tells us how to connect our <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-reminder-apps-for-android-654628/">github project with android studio</a> which is apart of the MVP we set for ourselves.

<h3>Where are you at in the process of your product? </h3>

<!--//Effectively considers current stage in EDP, plans for next stage.
Must state “engineering design process.”-->

<p> So far in our engineering design process although we haven't started coding as of yet we have come to a big realization.
We realized that we were just thinking about everything we wanted to do and not trying to plan an MVP.
The problem we had is that as we actually started to connect firebase to github we realized how long it will take us and that we might not reach an MVP in time for when the projects due.
We didn't need to do research to realize that we didn't need firebase for our app to work.
Essentially firebase would help us store the information of multiple users by providing the backend/database of our app.
While it'd be great to integrate firebase into our app our main focus as of right now is making sure that our app works.
On Friday one of our groupmates began to sketch out an idea of how we want the app to look like such as where each function goes and what that function will do.
We as a group will continue to build upon this prototype while also working on psuedocode.

<h3>What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project?
</h3>
<!--
Displays knowledge gained that applies to this entry, where applicable.-->

<p>One of the biggest things I get out of class everyday is the fact that asking for help is very helpful.
On 1/3/20 which was the most recent Friday in the beginning of class we had still thought that we had to have firebase so I was working on setting up the connection between github and firebase.
In all honestly it was a struggle because none of us in my group had seen anything like that before.
The direction were simple it was just the matter of finding out where everything was places on the firebase website.
I had gotten stuck on one of the very first directions that stated <strong>"Add the Client ID and Client Secret from that provider's developer console to the provider configuration...".</strong>
I just couldn't articulate what I was expected to fill in because of how official everything seemed.
I expressed my concerns to one of my groupmates and she helpfully had begun to research what I might've been expected to put.
Instead of isolating from the rest of my group I had brought up my concerns to my other groupmate which helped ease my frustration.
This in return will help us out in the future if we actually integrate firebase into our project.</p>




<h3>How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project?</h3>

<!--Reflects on at least two skills developed since the previous entry.-->
<!--Must state “skill/skills.”-->

<p>
Personally this time around I believe that taking things into consideration after our last Freedom Friday has improved.
At first I was thinking about how we wanted everything to come out and not actually taking in to consideration how these things are going to get done.
Through the communicating of our group we have been able to backtrack and take into consideration what we can actually get done as of right now.
We understand that we might not be able to get firebase done right now but we do know how to do html and java.
It's important to actually take your skills into consideration for when creating a project because although you can still LOYO (learn on your own) it makes sense to start off with the basics.
Furthermore another skill I've built upon would be our growth mindset as a group.
I say as a group our  growth mindset has improved since my previous entry because even when we get confused about something we continue to perservere and ask eachother questions.
