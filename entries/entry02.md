<h3>What are you using to learn?</h3>
<!--Uses (and links to) multiple sources effectively, where applicable.-->

<p> I will be working with two other partners who go by the name Elizabeth Vazquez and Nadia Ousman.
We have finalized our decision on creating an app that will need you to sign up and will store your information so it can accurately track the information of what medication your taking, when you need to take it, and how many you need to take.
Since the majority in the partnership have android as their phone the app we will be creating will be through Android Studio.
We have also assigned roles within our group on what coding language each of us will use.
Elizabeth's focus will be centered around Java and Nadia's focus will be on the HTML and CSS aspect of the project which will make the app look better.
I will focus more on firebase which will help take the login info and store it so the user will have proper access to their account.
Since firebase isn't something we learned in class I had to dive into the deep web to find proper resources to give me a basic understanding on what I could do with firebase and how it functions.</p>

<h3>Where are you at in the process of your product? </h3>

<!--//Effectively considers current stage in EDP, plans for next stage.
Must state “engineering design process.”-->

<p> So far in our engineering design process we haven't started our code but we have begun to download and research all the necessary tools we'll need for this project.
For example, we were able to download Android studio on the school computer which we will need because we are creating an app for androids.
As of right now we have the basic stuff done but we've been having trouble with figuring out how to use Android studio because of how complex it looks.
We have as a group looked at videos and have tried to determine how to use it's not like we haven't tried to educate ourselves on how to use the Android studio application it just remains to be somewhat confusing.
A personal struggle I've been going through is finding a simpler version on how to use firebase because at first glance firebase is difficult but with the right explanation I know I'll be able to understand.
Our most promising solution to these struggles is trial and error while simultaneously researching any missing components we might realize throughout the project.
As for our next step as a group, I believe we just need to communicate when we do feel like we are struggling with something so we can make an attempt to help each other out seeing as we are groupmates.</p>





<h3>What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project?
</h3>
<!--
Displays knowledge gained that applies to this entry, where applicable.-->

<p>This blog entry is going be submitted from the knowledge my groupmates and I gained throughout the second week to the fourth week of tinkering with the tools that we're using to ensure that our project cones out the way we need it to.
Over the past few weeks in addition to the project, we have our regular coursework in which we dedicate four days to our regular coursework and one to our project.
Trial and error is something that applies to nearly everything but also especially in code.
One tool that I believe all of us in our group uses and have learned is important is trial and error because it's ok to not get the coding activities correct the first time but we continue to try in order to succeed.
This method has become even more important as the coursework gets more difficult and I feel that trial and error is something I learn in class that directly applies to our project because even if you believe something small won't make a difference in your code it could
it could be the difference between something working and you continuing to fail.

<h3>How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project?</h3>

<!--Reflects on at least two skills developed since the previous entry.-->
<!--Must state “skill/skills.”-->

<p> I feel that I'm developing in being able to do better research when it comes to the lessons that we are required to complete in this course.
While to some it may seem that isn't too much of an important skill being able to look up the right things with the right keywords really can help you find better resources that you can learn from.
Instead of just being confused and giving up I've started to look up certain parts of something that I don't fully grasp.
Furthermore another skill I've begun to definitely improve in is embracing failure.
Failing doesn't mean that you're stupid it just means you need to spend more time on that subject that you don't understand.
These skills I feel go hand in hand because if you do fail at something being able to google something properly will help ensure that you do understand so you don't fail at that thing again.</p>
